#Bus Light Project

This project will probably not be of any use to any one but me. It has a very narrow scope. It checks whether my bus is coming within the next 15 minutes. If it is it lights up an led. Ever minute, the led starts blinking more quickly, until the bus is gone, at which point it stops.
